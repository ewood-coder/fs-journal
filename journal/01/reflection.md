# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Pretty much everything! It was a good refresher and I learned a lot of new stuff I didn't initially learn from my other courses. I feel much more capable now than I did before.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I think the biggest surprise was relearning bootstrap. I completely forgot how awesome it was a shocker to see how many different classes there are for it. It's very versatile.

- What are you struggling with?
So far, it would be time boxing. I'm quite the perfectionist and I find myself spending hours on a single, small issue that isn't worth wasting my time over. I need to get better at this because it is crucial for my future career and just development progress in general.

- What would you count as a victory?
The entire week! I feel like I crushed all the assignments this week and have gotten a lot better than when I first started. That however will change when logic based languages come into play.
