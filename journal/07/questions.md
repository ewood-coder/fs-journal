# Managing the Fullstack Application

1. Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?

  > | You can use one way data binding and two way data binding. With one way data binding there are interpolations and directives. The interpolation method uses double curly braces {{ }} to bind data to the HTML template. Directives in Vue provide directives, such as v-bind or : for short, to bind attributes to expressions. For example, v-bind:href binds the value of an expression to the href attribute.  |

2. The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

  > | A Single Page Application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This approach provides a more fluid and responsive user experience, as it minimizes page reloads and provides a more desktop-like feel to web applications. Vue.js, being a progressive JavaScript framework, is often used to build SPAs due to its efficient data binding, component-based architecture, and routing capabilities. |

3. What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?

  > | A few reasons 'SPA' is more advantageous is 1. Faster User Experience: SPAs load faster after the initial page load because they don't require the entire page to reload for each interaction. Only the necessary data is fetched from the server, and the DOM is updated dynamically, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience. 2. Improved Performance: Since SPAs only load data instead of entire pages, they reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, leading to improved performance, especially on slower networks or devices. 3. Smoother Navigation: SPAs often use client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the application without full page reloads. This creates a seamless browsing experience similar to that of native mobile applications. |

4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  > | The onMounted() Hook is used to perform logic after the component is mounted. In this example, it logs a message to the console. The onUpdated() Hook is used to execute logic after the component is updated. |

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

  > | This content is also available as a quick video tutorial. Vue v-model is a directive that creates a two-way data binding between a value in our template and a value in our data properties. A common use case for using v-model is when designing forms and inputs. We can use it to have our DOM input elements be able to modify the data in our Vue instance. |

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > | The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package. |

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

  > | There are a few including the v-if, v-else, v-if-else and v-show directive. The v-if directive conditionally renders the element based on the truthiness of the expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the element is rendered; otherwise, it is removed from the DOM. Of course v-else and v-if-else work with it as it would on a regular if or if-else statement. V-show, similar to v-if, also conditionally renders the element, but it does so by toggling the CSS display property instead of adding/removing elements from the DOM. The element remains in the DOM, but its visibility is controlled based on the truthiness of the expression. |

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

  > | The key attribute is used with the v-for directive so that Vue can tell the elements apart properly. Vue optimizes performance by reusing elements. So when elements are created from an array with v-for , if the key attribute is NOT used, element properties can be mixed when the array gets modified. |

9. What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?

  > | the <slot> element is a mechanism for creating reusable and flexible components by allowing the parent component to pass content into the child component. It's used in combination with the concept of scoped slots to facilitate the insertion of content into predefined slots within a component's template. |
