# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
	Nothing, I've been so stressed out I couldn't think or remember how to do anything.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
	Nothing was learned, as per usual.

- What are you struggling with?
	Everything. This includes having time to complete anything and just being able to complete them in general. I really can't retain anything I learn in regards to Javascript. For whatever reason my mind can only vaguely remember what things "look" like, but not whats actually supposed to be there. Not having a reference for issues and also not being able to write a single line of Javascript doesn't help with that.

- What would you count as a victory?
	Getting my events pulled to the home page. Took me three days just to do that.
