# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
	Everything surprisingly, i thought I'd struggle more. Thats probably due to tools like postman making it easier

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
	I don't know wether to say anything was a shock cause that seems to be the case with everything new I learn (after awhile I think i've just learned to expect the shock). It always throws me for a loop lol.

- What are you struggling with?
	With this stuff, i'd say the one thing i struggled with was knowing which controller controlled what and the file pathways a bit.

- What would you count as a victory?
	The entire week lol. This was the first week since we've started that I actually got my work done in class and I could have free time at home. Coding from 8am to 2-3am every day starts taking a toll and this week was a nice break.
