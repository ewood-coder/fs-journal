# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is a programming method that allows a class to inherit properties from another class, or class, called the parent class. The new class is called the derived class, and the current class is called the base class. Inheritance is a core feature of object-oriented programming. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | The Singleton method or Singleton Design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. It ensures a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. Sometimes it is used in excess and in scenarios where it is not required. In such cases, the disadvantages of using it outweigh the advantages it brings. For this reason, the singleton pattern is sometimes considered an antipattern or pattern singleton. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | The factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created without specifying the exact class that will be instantiated. Instead of creating objects directly, a factory method is used to create and return them. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology in software development that focuses on an iterative development cycle where the emphasis is placed on writing test cases before the actual feature or function is written. TDD utilizes repetition of short development cycles. It combines building and testing. This process not only helps ensure correctness of the code, but also helps to indirectly evolve the design and architecture of the project at hand. TDD usually follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle: 1. Add a test to the test suite, 2. (Red) Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails, 3. (Green) Write just enough code to get that single test to pass, 4. Run all tests, 5. (Refactor) Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green, 6. Repeat |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | The Definition of Done (DoD) in Scrum/Agile is a shared understanding of what a product increment must meet to be considered complete. It's a checklist of activities that add value to a product and is an essential part of a well-functioning scrum team. Verify: That all necessary value-added activities were completed, improve planning, visualize the status of projects over time, ensure work isn't duplicative |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | 1. As an online gamer, I want to have a multiplayer option so that I can play online with friends, 2. As a smart home owner, I want to control all of my smart devices from a single app |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | The sprint backlog is created during the sprint planning ceremony, which is attended by the entire team, including the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers. During this ceremony, PBIs (product backlog items) are moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog. |

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> | Sprint Planning allows the product owner and development team to review the prioritized product backlog usually in Scrum software. Through a series of discussions and negotiations, they identify items they are committing to complete by the end of the sprint. The product owner is responsible for this. |
