# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Everything AGAIN! This is quite unusual despite my previous reflections. My team made sure to assign people to things that they struggled with so that they got more exposure and experience. I thought it was incredibly smart seeing as our capstone was not graded so there was no pressure.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I can't say that anything was a shock or surprise, but I did learn to do things better that I already knew.

- What are you struggling with?
Everything except for HTML/CSS. This is something that i've been genuinely worried about since day 1 of Javascript. For whatever reason, the concepts and things we do just don't stick with me. I'm excited for the upcoming C# section (and thankfully i've touched it a lot from my associates at CWI so I'll start to remember some things here and there), but I'm worried I'll have the same issue there that I do with Javascript. At this point, I'm really stuck and desperate to find something or anything at all that can help me learn and retain Javascript. I can't write Javascript at all, with the exception of some VERY simple few word functions, and I just don't know what I need to do so I can learn it. I'm going to put a lot of effort into learning this stuff on my own time, but it seems like the go-to's for everyone else are not good for me. Documentation is just a bunch of big words that I have to look up and then their definitions are even more big words which creates an endless cycle of struggle and frustration. Simply writing javascript doesn't work because....I don't know javascript lol. I've been trying to use sites like CodeWars, but I've gotten stuck on functions that I just don't even know where to begin and therefore require me to look up the answer meaning I don't learn anything.
I'm not sure what to do about it at this point and I wish I could ask for help with it, but I just don't think there's a solution.

- What would you count as a victory?
Getting our project done! I had an awesome group of teammates and had a lot of fun talking and joking every day. We worked hard and I'm proud of us all for working so hard to get all these things that seemed new and scary implemented and improved upon. It was also cool seeing how everyone else coded versus myself, which taught me how to work with others to a degree. I also learned a lot from seeing the different ways everyone styled things giving me new ideas and inspirations.
