# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to finish my labs

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Nothing that was a shock or surprise, just frustrating tbh

- What are you struggling with?
Writing Javascript. I can create models and their data w/ templates fine, but once I need to create a function, mess with the controller or service, I just shut down and can't even begin to process where to start.

- What would you count as a victory?
I managed to write a single function for a stretch goal in my pokedex assignment. Sadly it was deleted because it didn't work, but it was written in a manner that people thought it SHOULD work so I'll take that as a compliment.
