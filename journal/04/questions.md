# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server. |

02. What is an event listener?

The programming paradigm of waiting and responding to real-time events is called event handling. |
