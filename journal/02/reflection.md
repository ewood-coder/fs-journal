# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
The functionality of my projects! I ended up with better results than I was expecting.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Nothing was really a shock or surprise for me, but I made a good bit of progress. I'm finally able to start writing functions without reference or help to a degree. Certain functions are easier for me to write than others. I'm good at making something called damageBoss(), but the moment you ask me to draw() something my brain just turns off sometimes.

- What are you struggling with?
Literally just coding in JavaScript. I'm making good progress (more than I thought I would) and starting to understand and be able to write certain things without assistance. However, I'm still very far from being able to do plenty of JS without anything other than myself. I know I can get better if I just keep working at it, but I also need to acknowledge that I've always been a slow learner too. However, I have developed into an exceptionally hard worker because of this and put in 10x the effort to achieve the results that I need to in order to succeed.

- What would you count as a victory?
Being able to write a little bit of JavaScript all on my own without references or guides. For me this is a pretty big deal, but I know this is only the beginning of my journey so I'm gonna keep working hard!
